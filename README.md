# Intro to Machine Learning Labs

## Lab 1: Intro to ML Packages: SKLearn
First, we'll walk through the [sentiment analysis tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/MLCodeLab/blob/master/lab1/sentiment_analysis_tutorial.ipynb) together, and cover how to build and tune models on SKLearn. Next, you'll apply what you learned, and work through the [news group excerise](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/MLCodeLab/blob/master/lab1/news_groups_exercise.ipynb), and [property prediction exercise]() yourself.

We'll provide a sample solution for both exercises on Thursday morning so you have a chance to experiment.
