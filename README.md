# Deep Learning Bootcamp Labs

## Lab 1: Intro to ML Packages: SKLearn
First, we'll walk through the [SKLearn tutorial](https://github.com/yala/deeplearning_bootcamp/blob/master/lab1/sklearn_tutorial.ipynb) together, and cover how to build and tune models on SKLearn. Next, you'll apply what you learned to two seperate exercises.

1. A molecule propety prediction exercise, where the task is to predict log p of a molecule from it's molecular structure. Here are the [exercise](https://github.com/yala/deeplearning_bootcamp/blob/master/lab1/property_prediction_exercise.ipynb) and [sample solution](https://github.com/yala/deeplearning_bootcamp/blob/master/lab1/sample_property_prediction_solution.ipynb)
2. A natural language inference (NLI) exercise, where the [task](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/multinli/) is to predictif a pair of sentences constitute an entailement, a contradiction, or neither. Here is the [exercise]() and [sample solution]().


## Lab 2: Intro to ML Packages: PyTorch
First, we'll walk through the [PyTorch tutorial](https://github.com/yala/deeplearning_bootcamp/blob/master/lab2/pytorch_tutorial.ipynb) together, and cover how to build and tune models on neural networks in pytorch for Vision tasks. Next, we'll discuss how to apply these same ideas to NLP tasks in our [NLP tutorial](https://github.com/yala/deeplearning_bootcamp/blob/master/lab2/nlp_tutorial.ipynb). Finally, we'll close the day with two seperate exercises:

1. A molecule propety prediction exercise (but this time with neural networks), where the task is to predict log p of a molecule from it's molecular structure. Here are the [exercise](https://github.com/yala/deeplearning_bootcamp/blob/master/lab2/property_prediction_exercise.ipynb) and [sample solution](https://github.com/yala/deeplearning_bootcamp/blob/master/lab2/property_prediction_solution.ipynb)
2. A natural language inference (NLI) exercise (but this time with neural networks), where the [task](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/multinli/) is to predictif a pair of sentences constitute an entailement, a contradiction, or neither. Here is the [exercise]() and [sample solution]().

## Lab 3: Advanced Neural Networks and Transfer Learning for NLP
